# Word Number Conversion

This is the coding assessment test for Pickle Robot. It contains three sections relating converting between words and numbers.

## Part 1: Number to Words

This function takes in an argument a string representing a US phone number and outputs a string that transforms part or all of a phone number into a single "wordified" phone number that can be typed on a US telephone.

For example, a valid output for "1-800-724-6837" would be "1-800-PAINTER". Possible to add constraint to only output "wordifications."

## Part 2: Words to Number

This function does the reverse of the previous function. For example, a valid output for "1-800-PAINTER" would be "1-800-724-6837."

## Part 3: All Wordifications

The function outputs all possible combination of numbers and English words in a given phone number.
